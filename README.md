# Laith Alkhalil — Portfolio (Next.js + Tailwind)

A professional, technical portfolio for a **Full-Stack Software Engineer**.
Showcases projects, experience, skills, and a **“Life Beyond Code”** gallery — built to be **fast**, **accessible**, and **easy to maintain**, with hands-off **CI/CD** via **GitHub Pages**.

**Live:** [https://laithse1.github.io/](https://laithse1.github.io/)

## ✨ Highlights

* **Modern stack:** Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
* **Design:** Dark-first UI, grid overlay, glowing accents, responsive layout
* **Content-first:** All data lives in small TypeScript files (`/src/data/*`)
* **Images:** Drop into `/public/images` and reference in `src/data/gallery.ts`
* **Performance:** Fully static export → instant page loads on GitHub Pages
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions builds and deploys on every push to `master`
* **Docker:** Multi-stage build; Nginx serves the static export locally or in a container

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Next.js 14** (App Router) with `output: 'export'` for static builds
* **Tailwind CSS 3** for utility-first styling
* **TypeScript** for safety and clarity
* **GitHub Actions** for build+deploy
* **Docker / Nginx** for local container preview
